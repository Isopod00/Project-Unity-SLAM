# Project-Unity-SLAM
A Unity Engine project for visualizing the map created by a stereo depth camera in VR. This project integrates with ROS 2 and its intended application is to serve as a natural human-robot interface for robotic exploration platforms.

I am using a fork of the Unity Robotics Hub [ROS-TCP-Connector](https://github.com/Isopod00/ROS-TCP-Connector) package because I needed to modify the shaders of the 3d drawer to support stereo rendering for VR.
